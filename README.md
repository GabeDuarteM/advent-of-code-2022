## Strutcure

This repo is divided into various folders on the root which represent the challenge of each day. Inside this folder, you will find the files `a.ts` and `b.ts`, which represents, respectively, the first and the second part of the challenge. Along with that, theres also the `input.txt` file, which is the input given by the site to use on the code.

## Running

To run the code for a specific day, you can run `npx nodemon <day>/<part>.ts`. E.g. `npx nodemon 5/a.ts` to run the first part of the challenge of the fifth day.
